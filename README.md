# WixEvents
1. Use Wix Events to set up an event and create free tickets based on different items that are being sold. All tickets being available at all events allows for a simpler integration here.
2. Export the Wix Guest List to get all guest info and ticket info in a .csv Excel file.
3. Import various guest lists from events into Google Drive.
4. Run AppScript on each guest list which generates confirmation emails for each guest. This specific appscript consolidates all tickets into one confirmation email if the same guest ordered multiple tickets.
5. Manually send emails out for now.
